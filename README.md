# Election-System
This Java-based Election System allows an admin to register voters and candidates, start a timed voting session, and view results. Voters can cast votes only during the valid voting period, and eligibility is based on age and unique CNIC. 
The system handles authentication, vote validation, reporting, and winner declaration securely and interactively.
